# Finance Sentiment Analysis - NLP

This project aims to analyze financial news articles, reports, and social media content to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) surrounding specific companies, industries, or financial markets. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze the text data, providing insights into market sentiments.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for backend, if applicable)
- React (for frontend, if applicable)

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies financial text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays sentiment trends over time.
- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Process and analyze financial data from various sources.
- **Interactive Web Interface** (if applicable): Provides a user-friendly platform to interact with the analysis results.

## Installation

This guide will help you set up and run the **Finance Sentiment Analysis** project, which consists of a **React frontend** and **Flask backend**. 

### ✅ *Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project*

#### 🗂 1. *Unzip the Project*
- Locate the `.zip` file you downloaded.
- *Right-click → Extract All* or use any unzip tool.
- You’ll now have a folder containing:
  - `frontend/` (React project)
  - `backend/` (Flask project)

---

#### 💻 2. *Open the Project in VS Code*
- Open *VS Code*.
- Go to *File → Open Folder...*
- Select the unzipped project folder (the one that contains both `frontend` and `backend`).

---

#### 🌐 3. *Install Frontend Dependencies*
- Open a *new terminal* in VS Code.
- Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install

4. Set Up Python Backend

    Open a new terminal (or split the existing one).

    Navigate to the backend folder:

cd ../backend

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

        source venv/bin/activate

📦 5. Install Backend Requirements

    Ensure you are in the backend directory and the virtual environment is activated.

    Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 6. Run the Python Backend

    While still in the backend directory:

python app.py

You should see the following message:

    Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

🌍 7. Run the Frontend React App

    Go back to the terminal where the frontend is set up (or open a new one).

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Start the React app:

    npm start

    The React app will open in your browser (usually on http://localhost:3000).
